Cucumber
Behavior Driven Development -is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, etc., understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.
Advantage of cucumber
Feature file
Step definations
Scenario outline
Background
Gerkhins - given when then and background
Regular expression
In which language cucumber is written - Ruby
What are the maximum numbers of scenarios that we can includ in the feature file?-10 (vary project to project)
cucumber dry run-used to compile cucumber features files and step definitions. It is run to find any compilation errors. If it finds anyone, it will show when we use dry run.
TestRunner class-In the Cucumber testing approach, the TestRunner class provides the link between the feature file and the step definition file. The TestRunner class is generally an empty class with no class definition.
How can you use the Options tag in the Cucumber framework?-
Feature Parameter & Glue parameter
What is the use of features property under the Cucumber Options tag?-used to identify the location of the feature files.
What is the use of glue property under the Cucumber Options tag?-used to facilitate the Cucumber framework to identify the location of step definition files.
What is the use of hooks in the Cucumber framework?-used to control the flow of the program and optimize lines of code. A block of code tagged with hooks in Cucumber can run before or post a scenario with the help of @Before and @After annotations.
